I am a PhD student in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) at [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca) and a Research Assistant at [Network Systems Lab (NSL)](https://nsl.cs.sfu.ca/) under supervison of [Dr. Mohamed Hefeeda](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~mhefeeda/). My research interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning, particularly:
1. Multimedia Forensics
1. Biometric Systems
1. Hyperspectral Data Transmission

I have received my M.Sc. in 2019 and my thesis was "[Band and Quality Selection for Efficient Transmission of Hyperspectral Images](http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/19409/etd20421.pdf)". Before joining SFU, I got my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University of Tehran, Iran.
